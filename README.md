# YouTubeDownloader
This python script uses a GUI, which allows the user to input a YouTube link.  The user has a choice between downloading the video, or just the audio.  There is also a choice between resolutions: 360p, or 720p.  After clicking download, the video will be downloaded to the same file location that the script is in.
